The command line is another way to communicate commands to your computer via text prompts instead of using the mouse to click on menus, buttons and folders. This technique can make the process of communicating with your computer much more efficient. As an example, you can ask the computer to peform the task on several files at once.

1 pwd
print working directory - print on screen the folder or file you are currently working in

2 ls
list all the files in the folder you are currently working in

3 cd ~
go to user home directory

4 mkdir
make a new directory (folder)

5 touch
create a new empty file

6 rm
remove a file

7 rm -r remove a directory (and all files within it)

8 open
open a file (in default program)

9 open .
open current directory

10 exit
exit terminal
